You are improving an existing Flask + SQLite + Bootstrap 5 website for “Nawarat Thai Mat og Catering” (language: Norwegian). Important: Keep the current design and style. Do not change the color palette, font, or base layout. Do not add e-commerce. Only make small refinements across the entire site for better readability and visual balance — and completely rebuild the Catering page from scratch (while keeping the same visual style).

Keep and fine-tune globally (no redesign):
Keep existing colors, fonts, spacing, and components.

Fine-tune:

Margins/padding (consistent spacing, slightly more breathing room under section headers).

Mobile readability: keep current base font size; adjust line height and spacing between lists/badges for comfort.

Button sizing: maintain style, ensure large tap targets on mobile.

Add missing image alt-text for accessibility.

Improve short microcopy (buttons/error messages) in Norwegian for clarity.

Do not change the existing menu items (01–17), image file names, or admin login path.

Completely rebuild the /catering page (same style, better structure):
Goal: Clean, scannable, action-oriented. No new visual identity — just clear structure and better flow.

New structure:
Hero (short and clear)

Title: “Catering for businesses and events in Gjøvik” (Norwegian equivalent)

Subtitle: 1–2 sentences for trust (delivery time, allergen handling).

Primary button: “Get catering offer” (scrolls to request form). Secondary: “See packages”.

Packages grid (Menyforslag 1–6)

Display as equal-height cards:

Name (Menyforslag 1–6)

Price per person (199–385 NOK — exact from database)

Short description of what’s included

Minimum pax (if applicable)

Allergens (badges)

Buttons: “Details” (anchor/scroll to details) and “Get offer” (opens form/scrolls)

Grid should be 1-column on mobile, 2–3 on desktop (match existing card style).

Optional comparison section (table)

Compact table comparing packages 1–6: Price per person, Included dishes, Vegetarian option, Delivery included?, Minimum pax, Suitable for.

Match existing table styling, no new colors.

Detailed package sections (anchor links)

For each package: title, short intro, bullet list of contents, allergens, optional add-ons (extra starters/desserts), and “Best for…” note.

Primary button: “Get catering offer” (scroll/anchor to form).

Use same card/heading style as rest of site.

Request form (simple, clear)

Fields: Name, Company (optional), Email, Phone, Number of guests, Desired date, Delivery or pickup (radio), Address (only if delivery), Selected package (1–6 or “Not sure”), Notes (allergies, requests).

Requirements: HTML5 + server-side validation, clear error messages.

On success: green confirmation message with summary.

Keep backend flow as in current project.

FAQ (short, useful)

4–6 questions in accordion style: Delivery area, Order deadline, Allergens/customization, Minimum pax, Cancellation, Payment.

Short answers, Norwegian, match typography/margins used elsewhere.

Contact/trust section

Short block with “Call us” button (tel:), opening hours, and friendly line: “Not sure what to choose? We’ll help you quickly by phone or email.”

Same button/link style as rest of site.

UX / Accessibility / Performance tweaks (small, no redesign):
Logical heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3).

Visible focus state on all links/buttons.

alt attributes on all images.

loading="lazy" for off-screen catering images.

No blocking JS; keep existing bundling.

No new fonts or colors.

Admin (only if functions already exist):
Do not rebuild admin. Only ensure catering packages (1–6) can be edited with new fields used in the rebuilt page (description, price per person, min. pax, allergens, “best for” note).

Keep table names and columns; only add fields if already supported. No DB migration unless necessary.

Text / microcopy (Norwegian, short):
Button texts: “See packages”, “Get catering offer”, “Send request”, “Call us”.

Error: “Please fill out this field.”, “Invalid email address.”

Success: “Thank you! We’ll contact you shortly to confirm the details.”

Acceptance criteria:
Design looks the same (same colors, fonts, button style), but with better spacing and balance.

Catering page shows packages in a clear grid, has a simple form, and a FAQ, and is easy to scan on mobile.

No changes to menu 01–17, file names, or admin login.

All text remains in Norwegian, all images have alt text, focus states are clear for keyboard users.

Go through the code and implement the above without introducing new visual systems. Keep look & feel — just improve structure, spacing, and text rhythm. Priority: (1) Catering page clarity → (2) Small site-wide readability/spacing tweaks → (3) Form UX.
